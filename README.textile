h2. iPhone2iTunes! YEah!

h3. The Point

Browse and watch all the video files you have in your iTunes library on your iPhone.

<code> This only works locally. Unless you expose your webserver and you have kick ass bandwidth.</code>

h3. Setup

Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and set its users to your user name:

<pre><code>
	User jmaddox
	Group www
</code></pre>

Symlink your tv and movie directories from your iTunes library to your webserver directory:

<pre><code>
$	ln -s /Users/jmaddox/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music/Movies movies
$	ln -s /Users/jmaddox/Music/iTunes/iTunes\ Music/TV\ Shows tv
</code></pre>

Make SURE you use the same symbolic link names as above.

Dump all of this at the root of /Library/WebServer/Documents

Turn on web sharing!

That should be it. Simple as pie.
